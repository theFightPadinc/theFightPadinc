- 👋 Hi, I’m @theFightPadinc
- 👀 I’m interested in bringing a new experience to gaming with our new 8-way dpad allowing users to gain full control of movement in games both old and new
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to spread the word that a new world awaits when it comes to the innovation we hope to bring with our new controller
- 💞️ I’m looking to connect and hear from others who've grown tired of the same dpad designs and limitations
- 📫 You can reach our company by visiting our many social media outlets on most major playforms, just look for theFightPad, or theFightPadinc
- 😄 Pronouns: Anything but your average Dpad
- ⚡ Fun fact: This company along with the need for this groundbreaking came from the humble struggles of trying to Korean Backdash in Tekken, and particularly Marduks combos!
